# Welcome to the C parameter-passing coding exercises!

You are here because either you have taken `CMSC 21` or `CMSC 123` last sem.

This code compilation comes with some coding exercises that are meant to help you review how data are passed as 
parameters to C functions starting from integers, arrays, strings, structures and up to intro to linked list.

## Files and Folders

Each folder contains codes for input/output (I/O) functions of the 
corresponding data that are being passed as parameter to C functions.

For example, inside the `01 Integer` folder, you will find the following files:

```bash
$ ls
params01.c  params01_exer1_ans1.c  params01_exer1_ans2.c  params01_exer1.c
```  

+ `params01.c` is the base code
+ `params01-exer1.c` is the exercise file
+  and, `params01-exer1-ans1.c` contains the answers


## Exercises

You may compile and run the base code first

e.g. 

```bash
$ gcc params01.c
$ ./a.out
```  
When you open `params01.c` in an editor, you will see that the main function
simply calls the printf and scanf functions.

The exercise files e.g. `params01-exer1.c`, have missing codes that you have to fill-up as exercises.

Your goal is to simply make the exercise file run like the base code, and that's mainly applying the right parameter-passing to C functions.

The rest of the tasks simply entail transfering the codes from the main 
function into the corresponding I/O functions.


## Answers to Exercises
Files containing the answer to the exercises are provided.

e.g. `params01-exer1-ans1.c` contains the answer for `params01-exer1.c` exercise. 

NOTE: Try to answer the exercise first, ON YOUR OWN, before you check the answers.

Enjoy!
