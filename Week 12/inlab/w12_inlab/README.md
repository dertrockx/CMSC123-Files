This folder contains your exercise which is to implement a BFS algorithm using a graph representation of your choice.
The `template` folder has the DFS implementation template and uses the given `adj_list` implementation.
The `exer` folder has the answer for the DFS implementation and you should place your BFS implementation there as well.
You can use either `adj_list` or `adj_matrix` for your exercise.
